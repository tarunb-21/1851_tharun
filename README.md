TARUN COURSE PROJECT:-

## 📌 Abstract

The **Player Profile Management System** is a console-based C application designed to store, manage, and update gaming player records efficiently. Using structured programming and file handling, the system allows users to create and manage multiple player profiles with details such as name, age, level, and score. It includes search, score update, and automatic data loading from file, making it a lightweight yet robust player database management system.
This project demonstrates the use of **structures, arrays, menu-driven programming, loops, file handling, and user interaction** — making it ideal for learners and academic submissions.
